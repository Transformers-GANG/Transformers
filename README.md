![Transformers Logo]()  
*“More than meets the eye—coding Autobots ready to roll out!”*

Welcome to the **Transformers** team page for the **Krutiverse Hackathon**! We’re a squad of four coding warriors, here to build something epic, break some barriers, and maybe sneak in a few laughs along the way. Buckle up as we take you on a journey through our project, our team, and the chaos that fuels our creativity! 💥

## 🛠️ About the Project:

The Real-Time Blood Donation Management Web App is designed to efficiently match blood donors with recipients based on blood type, health conditions, and real-time availability. The system continuously tracks donors and recipients, ensuring that the best possible match is found and notifying both parties when a suitable match is identified.
