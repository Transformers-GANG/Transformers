# 🌌 Krutiverse Hackathon: Transformers Team 🚀

*“More than meets the eye—coding Autobots ready to roll out!”*

Welcome to the **Transformers** team page for the **Krutiverse Hackathon**! We’re a squad of four coding warriors, here to build something epic, break some barriers, and maybe sneak in a few laughs along the way. Buckle up as we take you on a journey through our project, our team, and the chaos that fuels our creativity! 💥

## 🛠️ About the Project:
# 🧠 Human emotion and mental health detector

## 🌟 Overview
The **Human Emotion and Mental Health Detector** is an innovative machine learning project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify signs of depression through advanced image and text analysis. Our goal is to provide an automated, early-intervention tool for mental health assessment, offering compassionate and data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Modal Analysis**: 
  - Advanced CNN-based detection of depression signs through images and text
  - Real-time emotion and mental health assessment
- **Comprehensive Emotion Detection**: 
  - Identifies 8 distinct emotional states
  - Generates a personalized depression severity score
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: 
  - Generative AI provides tailored mental health guidance
  - Personalized coping strategies based on individual assessment

## 🔬 Technical Details
### Dataset and Model Training
- **Dataset Size**: 16,000 carefully curated images
- **Emotion Categories**: 8 distinct emotional states
- **Model Architecture**: 
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Multi-layer feature extraction
  - Advanced emotion recognition algorithms

### Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: 
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - OpenCV
- **AI Integration**: 
  - Generative AI for personalized recommendations
- **Web Framework**: 
  - Django
- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Transformers-GANG/Transformers
   cd Transformers
   ```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
# Windows
py -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Database Migrations
```bash
# Windows
py manage.py makemigrations
py manage.py migrate
py manage.py createsuperuser

# macOS/Linux
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 5. Launch the Application
```bash
# Windows
py manage.py runserver

# macOS/Linux
python manage.py runserver
```

## 🤖 How It Works
1. **Input Collection**: 
   - User provides image or text input
   - Secure and privacy-focused data handling

2. **Emotion Analysis**: 
   - CNN processes input
   - Identifies emotional markers
   - Generates emotional state profile

3. **Depression Assessment**: 
   - Comprehensive scoring mechanism
   - Calculates depression likelihood
   - Considers multiple emotional indicators

4. **AI Recommendation Engine**: 
   - Generative AI analyzes assessment
   - Provides personalized mental health guidance
   - Suggests coping strategies and resources
