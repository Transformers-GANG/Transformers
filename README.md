# 🧠 Depression Detector using CNN

## 🌟 Overview
The **Depression Detector** is an innovative machine learning project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify signs of depression through advanced image and text analysis. Our goal is to provide an automated, early-intervention tool for mental health assessment, offering compassionate and data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Modal Analysis**: 
  - Advanced CNN-based detection of depression signs through images and text
  - Real-time emotion and mental health assessment
- **Comprehensive Emotion Detection**: 
  - Identifies 8 distinct emotional states
  - Generates a personalized depression severity score
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: 
  - Generative AI provides tailored mental health guidance
  - Personalized coping strategies based on individual assessment
